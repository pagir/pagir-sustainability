**Digital public-good infrastructure** connecting planetary limits (ecological ceiling) with human well-being (social foundation).

> *PAGIR* (பகிர்) means "to share" in Tamil — shared intelligence for regeneration.

## 🌱 The Vision

PAGIR empowers communities, researchers, cooperatives, and organizations to understand their impacts and design actions that:
- **Respect planetary boundaries** (ecological ceiling)
- **Lift all people** (social foundation)
- **Build commons** (open knowledge)

A world where every decision considers both Earth's limits and human dignity.

## ✨ What PAGIR Does

PAGIR transforms scientific and lived knowledge into actionable intelligence across **four interconnected layers**:

### 1. 🏭 Operational Intelligence
**Turn facilities into sustainable and regenerative assets**  
```
"Net Zero 2040" goal → VFD on Motor M-12 → -47.5 tCO2e saved → Track live performance
```
Energy retrofits, water optimization, waste reduction, regenerative agriculture integration, and more.

### 2. 🧬 Product Intelligence  
**Design circular products from first principles**
```
BOM upload → Flash LCA → MCI score → C2C-safe Material Passport
```
Streamlined assessments, circularity metrics, toxin screening, packaging optimization, and more.

### 3. ⚖️ Compliance Intelligence
**Generate Audit-ready reports aligned with global frameworks**
```
Factory data → CBAM XML → GRI 302-1 → CSRD disclosure → Digital Product Passports
```
Carbon border taxes, EPD preparation, global standards export, regulatory proof, and more.

### 4. 🌍 Regenerative Intelligence
**Ensure actions fit the Safe & Just Space**
```
Action impact → Planetary Boundaries check → Social foundation metrics → "Regenerate ✓"
```
Doughnut context, planetary limits, shared prosperity validation, holistic decision support, and more.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pagir/pagir-sustainability.git
cd pagir-sustainability  
python scripts/setup_dev.py
```

### Run Your First Analysis
```bash
python engine.py
```

**Sample Output:**
```
━━━ PAGIR REGENERATIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT ━━━
Asset: MTR-001 → VFD Retrofit Recommendation

Planetary Impact: -47.5 tCO2e/year (Within Safe Space ✓)
Prosperity Impact: +2 local jobs (Above Social Floor ✓)
Circularity: MCI 0.72 (Good - 72% material retention)

Status: RECOMMENDED for implementation
