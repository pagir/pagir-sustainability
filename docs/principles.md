# PAGIR Principles (Pre-Ratification)

> **Proposed immutable laws of PAGIR.**  
> Ratification: Post 3 pilots + initial community

---

## **1. Flywheel Law** ⚙️
**Every deployment feeds the commons.**

*Platform gets smarter with every use. Verified outcomes improve recommendations for all.*

User Input → Actions → Verified Outcomes → Enriched Intelligence → Better Actions → ∞

- All hosted instances contribute anonymized, verified results (AGPL-3.0 enforcement)
- No intervention without empirical validation (3+ independent pilots)
- Impact scoring = `(tCO₂e × replication × longevity) / (cost × risk)`

## **2. Open Commons Law** 🔓
**100% AGPL-3.0 forever. No exceptions.**

*Copyleft ensures network effects. Hosted modifications must be shared back.*

Code + Templates + Intelligence = Public Domain Commons
Hosted → Must Share Modifications | Fork → 6-month merge window

- Export everything. Run anywhere. No lock-in.
- Network effects > proprietary moats

## **3. Progressive Truth Law** 🔬
**No action without evidence.**

*Interventions battle-tested before library inclusion. Quality compounds over time.*

Phase 1: Hypothesis → Phase 2: 3+ Pilots → Phase 3: Library → Phase 4: Golden Standard

| Score | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| <1.0 | Archived | Failed validation |
| 1-2.5 | Experimental | Use with caution |
| 2.5-4.0 | Recommended | Default choice |
| >4.0 | Best Practice | Auto-recommended |

## **4. Domain Atomicity Law** 🧬
**Modules evolve independently, intelligence cascades universally.**

*Energy, agriculture, products and etc evolve in parallel. Cross-domain learning accelerates all.*

```
actions/
├── energy/motors/vfd.yaml
├── agriculture/regen/cover-crops.yaml
├── products/circularity.yaml
└── [community-defined]/
```
- New domains bootstrap from existing intelligence
- Parallel evolution, universal learning

## **5. Economic Alignment Law** 💰
**Impact creates value for all contributors.**  

*Verified outcomes generate shared prosperity. Planetary results = universal currency.*

| Stakeholder | Contribution | Reward |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Users | Outcomes data | Better recommendations |
| Contributors | Templates/code | Impact Points + stewardship |
| Hosts | Infrastructure | 5% impact fee |
| Funders | Capital | Planetary ROI |

**Impact Points = `(verified tCO₂e × quality) + (templates adopted × 10)`**

## **6. No Tyranny Law** ⚖️
**Decentralization protects the commons.**
*Progressive ownership prevents capture. No single entity dominates governance.*

**Phase 1:** Founder stewardship → **Phase 2:** Domain councils → **Phase 3:** Global assembly

- No entity >33% voting power
- 20% revenue → community grants
- Annual independent impact audit

### **Ratification Process**

DRAFT → 3 pilots → Initial community → RATIFIED (IPFS + Git)

**First 10 contributors get founding steward status.**

---
### **Amendment Protocol (Post-Ratification)**
```
GATE 1: RFC Proposal (Community discussion)
GATE 2: Domain Councils (Majority approval)
GATE 3: Global Assembly (75% threshold)
GATE 4: 90-Day Ratification (live pilots)
```

## **Current Status**

🗓️ *Proposed:* 2025-12-22 | 👤 [pagir](https://github.com/pagir) | 📄 [Commit abc123]

📜 *Status:* DRAFT ✅ | Pilots: 0/3 | Contributors: 0/10 | tCO₂e: 0/1M

## **The Sacred Contract**

> **PAGIR exists for the planet through the community.**  
> These principles will make it antifragile, unstoppable, eternal.
