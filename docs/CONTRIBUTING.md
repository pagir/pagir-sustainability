# Contributing to PAGIR

PAGIR grows through community contributions. **Highest impact first:**

## 🌾 **Action Templates**
**Best for:** Domain experts, practitioners, sustainability professionals

1. Check: `actions/energy/` (or agriculture/products/cities)
2. Copy: `actions/templates/action_template.yaml`
3. Fill: preconditions, tCO₂e savings, cost, verification method


**Quality bar:**
✅ Real-world tested (your org/study)
✅ Impact range: 50-150 tCO₂e/year
✅ 2+ references (studies/invoices)
✅ Verification: meter/invoice/audit


**First 10 authors → Founding steward status**

## 🧪 **Run a Pilot** 
**Best for:** Organizations with real data

**We learn most from real tCO₂e verification.** If you have:
- Baseline data (energy use, emissions)
- Willing to share anonymized outcomes
- 2-4 hours for setup + 3-month follow-up

→ File: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pilot-report.md
→ Library improves for 1,000+ orgs


**Pilots get priority support + case study credit**
