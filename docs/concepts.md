# PAGIR Concepts

PAGIR makes advanced sustainability frameworks practical for factory managers like Ajith.

## Donut Economics

**The "safe and just space" for humanity:**
```
Ecological Ceiling ← Planet boundaries (CO₂, energy use)
┌──────────────┐
│ DONUT │ ← PAGIR sweet spot
│ │
Social Foundation ───→ Basic needs (jobs, health, equity)
└──────────────┘
```

**PAGIR application:**
- **Ceiling**: Energy reduction targets (20% by 2028), CO₂e tracking
- **Foundation**: Job-creating actions (VFD retrofits → maintenance upskilling)
- **Donut**: Actions that save energy *while* maintaining production

## Triple Bottom Line

**People + Planet + Profit** – all three must improve:

| Aspect | PAGIR Example | Impact |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Planet** | VFD on 50 kW pump | 20,000 kWh → 16 tCO₂e saved |
| **Profit** | Electricity savings | ₹1.5L/year |
| **People** | Maintenance team | Learns VFD installation |

## Circular Economy (Butterfly Diagram)

**From linear "Take-Make-Waste" → Closed loops:**
```
Raw materials → Manufacturing → Use → Reuse/Refurbish → Recycle
↑ ↓
Biological nutrients loop ←───────────────────────────┘
↑ Technical nutrients loop
```


**PAGIR actions map to loops:**
- **Refurbish**: VFD retrofits extend motor life
- **Renewables**: Leak detection reduces wasted energy
- **Share**: Shared action libraries improve estimates

## Scope 1/2 Carbon Footprints

**PAGIR tracks what factories control:**
```
Scope 1: Direct emissions
├── Fuel combustion (boilers, generators)
└── Company vehicles

Scope 2: Purchased electricity ← PAGIR Primary Focus
└── Plant energy use (baseline CSV)

Scope 3: Indirect (supply chain) ← Future expansion

```

**Example calculation:**
```
Plant: 500,000 kWh/year × 0.8 kgCO₂e/kWh (India grid)
= 400 tCO₂e Scope 2
Target: 20% reduction = 80 tCO₂e saved by 2028
```

## Reporting Frameworks Mapping

PAGIR aligns actions to mandatory disclosures:

| Framework | PAGIR Coverage | Key Metrics |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **BRSR** | Principle 6 (Energy) | Energy use, emissions |
| **GRI** | 302 Energy, 305 Emissions | kWh consumed, CO₂e saved |
| **TCFD** | Climate risk mitigation | Energy cost volatility |
| **CSRD** | Energy efficiency actions | Action implementation rate |

## Built by Sustainability Practitioner

PAGIR incorporates concepts from:
- [Applied Sustainability for Technical Managers](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/applied-sustainability-technical-managers) ⭐
- [Sustainable Operations & Supply Chains](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/sustainable-resilient-operations-supply-chains)
- [Sustainable Product Development](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/8V4BJN30852B)

**Every concept → concrete real time action.**
